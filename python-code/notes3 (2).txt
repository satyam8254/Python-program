Recap:

 - Sorting
 - Soring the process of arraging or rearranging the elements of a list in an order
 - There are multiple algorithms or ways to sort a list of items
 - Insertion sort:
    - We should consider the first element of the list of items to always be sorted
    - There are always two parts of the list: sorted part, unsorted part
    - For each elkement, we are going to compare it with the sorted part of the list,
      and finally insert in it's correct postion

- Insertion sort is an inplace sorting algorithm
- It is an inplace sorting algorithm because, we are basically modifying the input array to find the sorted list of elements

- Insertion sort space complexity: O(1), Constant space complexity

What is correctness?

 Corectness of an algorithm is asserted when it is said that the algorithm is implemented with respect to its specification

Establish the correctness of insertion sort
 - we will do that using loop invariance
 - It is a property that does not change across iterations of a loop.
 - It is tool to prove correctness

A loop invariant can be divided into 3 distinct parts:

1. Initialization: The property is true before the loop runs

2. Maintainance: The property is true in each iteration of the loop

3. Termination: It will terminate once execution is finished

To prove the correctness of insertion sort, this is the loop invariant:

 - At the start of every iteration of the outer loop (for loop), indexed with i, the subarray until array[i]
 consists of the original elements that were there, but in sorted order

 - Initialization: The subarray starts with the first element of the list, and since at that time the subarrays contains only one item and is sorted

 - Maintainance: - Every element on the left of the current element is sorted
                 - The size of the sorted sub array increases gradually
                 - Each element in the sorted sub array was already present in the original array

 - Termination: The code will terminate after i has reached the last element in the list
