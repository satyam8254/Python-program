Codes discussed in today's Lecture
Search
Linear Search
===============================
Binary Search
- Sorted dataset
- Pick divider
- Understand with an example
- Answer not present
- How to decide if BS to be used
- 2 pointer
- Input : sorted dataset, element to Search
- Output : index of element
- Write Pseudo code
- pointer change
- pointer condition
- variation of sort order(Descending)
- Implementation(iterative & recursive)
- Complexity
- Example : Search first occurance of element
- Example : Search last occurance of element
- Example : Count of an element present using linear and binary search
- Example : Search an element in a 2D array.
- Count number of rotations of a sorted array.
Pseudo code :
BinarySearch(arr, left, right, elem)
  while (left<=right)
    calculate mid
    Check with mid, if elem == arr[mid] return mid
    if arr[mid] > elem
        right = mid-1
    else
        left = mid +1
  return -1
